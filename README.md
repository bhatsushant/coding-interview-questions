## How to run the programs

In a terminal

    $ cd exercises/
    $ jest exercise_name/test.js --watch

For example `jest anagrams/test.js --watch`

Save the index.js file for that particular exercise (For ex. save the file index.js in the exercises/anagrams folder) and the tests should run automatically.

## Programs

**1. String Reversal** - Given a string, return a new string with the reversed order of characters. `(exercises/reversestring)`

**2. Palindrome** - Given a string, return true if the string is a palindrome or false if it is not. `(exercises/palindrome)`

**3. Integer Reversal** - Given a string, return true if the string is a palindrome or false if it is not. `(exercises/reversestring)`

**4. Maximum characters in a string** - Given a string, return the character that is most commonly used in the string. `(exercises/maxchar)`

**5. fizzbuzz** - Write a program that console logs the numbers from 1 to n. But for multiples of three print “fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “fizzbuzz”. `(exercises/fizzbuzz)`

**6. Array Chunking** - Given an array and chunk size, divide the array into many subarrays where each subarray is of length size. `(exercises/chunk)`

**7. Anagrams** - Check to see if two provided strings are anagrams of eachother. `(exercises/anagrams)`

**8. Sentence Capitalization** - Write a function that accepts a string. The function should capitalize the first letter of each word in the string then return the capitalized string. `(exercises/capitalize)`

**9. Printing Steps** - Write a function that accepts a positive number N. The function should console log a step shape with N levels using the # character. `(exercises/steps)`
